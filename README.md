# SPDM-UNICORN
This project aims to integrate libspdm with the Unicorn CPU Emulator to simulate a Root Complex and Endpoint Device. The core functionalities of secure communication, device authentication, and obtaining measurement reports are implemented using libspdm. The project is currently under development and is being continuously updated.

Simulation: Utilize Unicorn to simulate the hardware components (Root Complex and Endpoint Device).
Security: Implement secure communication protocols between the simulated devices using libspdm.
Authentication: Ensure device authentication is handled securely via libspdm.
Measurement Reports: Retrieve and verify measurement reports as part of the security protocol.
